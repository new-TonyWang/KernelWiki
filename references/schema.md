# Schema Reference

Condensed reference for the wiki's controlled vocabulary and page schemas. Full definitions live in `data/schemas.yaml`.

## Page Types and IDs

Every page has a unique `id` with a type-specific prefix:

| Type | ID Prefix | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| source-pr | `pr-<repo>-<N>` | A merged PR from a tracked repo |
| source-doc | `doc-*` | Official NVIDIA docs, papers |
| source-blog | `blog-*` | Community blog posts, tutorials |
| source-contest | `contest-*` | Competition problems / tracks |
| source-experience | `exp-*` | Hardware probe / measurement records |
| wiki-hardware | `hw-*` | Hardware feature pages |
| wiki-technique | `technique-*` | Optimization techniques |
| wiki-kernel | `kernel-*` | Kernel case studies with perf claims |
| wiki-pattern | `pattern-*` | Problem → solution diagnosis |
| wiki-language | `lang-*` | DSL / language guides |
| wiki-migration | `migration-*` | Hopper → Blackwell migration |
| wiki-skill | `skill-*` | Foundational CUDA optimization skills |
| wiki-api-definition | `api-*` | API definitions (CUDA Runtime, PTX) |
| wiki-experience | `exp-*` | Hardware measurement / probe records |
| wiki-operator-routing | `routing-*` | Operator decision trees |
| wiki-algorithm | `algo-*` | Classical optimization algorithms |
| wiki-code-walkthrough | `code-*` | Code repository extractions |
| wiki-pitfall | `pitfall-*` | Common pitfalls and gotchas |

## Vendor Field

All wiki pages under `wiki/{vendor}/` carry an optional `vendor` field. When present, it must match the path vendor prefix. Pages may also carry `source_refs` for MANIFEST-backed external repository references (coexists with `sources` which holds wiki/source page IDs).

```

## Confidence Levels

- **`verified`**: Requires ≥1 `official-doc` + ≥1 `upstream-code` in sources. Enforced by validator.
- **`source-reported`**: Cited by ≥1 authoritative source (paper, major blog, major repo).
- **`inferred`**: Synthesized from multiple sources, no single authoritative one.
- **`experimental`**: Undocumented, PTX tricks, version-sensitive. Include CUDA version.

## Reproducibility Levels

For `wiki-technique`, `wiki-kernel`, `wiki-language`, must be ≥ `snippet`.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `concept` | Text only |
| `pseudocode` | Language-agnostic algorithm |
| `snippet` | Compilable code fragment (verified by validator) |
| `runnable` | Self-contained buildable example |
| `benchmarked` | Runnable + perf numbers with env metadata |

## Controlled Vocabulary

All values in these fields must appear in `data/tags.yaml`:

- **architectures**: sm100, sm100a, sm90, sm90a, sm120
- **hardware_features**: tcgen05, tmem, tma, clc, 2sm-cooperative, pdl, gdc, nvfp4, fp8, fp6, fp4, block-scale, wgmma, cluster, mbarrier
- **techniques**: warp-specialization, persistent-kernel, swizzling, pipeline-stages, double-buffering, register-reuse, epilogue-fusion, tile-scheduling, tma-multicast, software-exp, fine-grained-quantization, cuda-core-promotion, jit-compilation, vectorized-loads, cache-policy, kernel-fusion, chunk-parallelism, loop-unrolling, register-budgeting, shared-memory-optimization, ping-pong-scheduling, conditional-rescaling, data-reuse, per-k-specialization
- **kernel_types**: gemm, attention, moe, sparse-attention, gemv, grouped-gemm, gated-delta-net, fused-kernel, decode, prefill, quantization, flash-attention, mla, linear-attention, gated-dual-gemm, batched-gemv
- **languages**: cuda-cpp, cute-dsl, triton, tilelang, cutile, ptx, python, jax-pallas
- **source_category**: official-doc, upstream-code, paper, benchmark-blog, contest-report, community-note

## Canonical Aliases (from data/aliases.yaml)

When asking about:
- UMMA → canonical tag is `tcgen05`
- Tensor Memory / TMEM → `tmem`
- Cluster Launch Control / CLC → `clc`
- Blackwell / B200 → architecture `sm100`
- Hopper / H100 → architecture `sm90`
- MoE / Mixture of Experts → `moe`
- MLA / Multi-head Latent Attention → `mla`
- GDN / Gated Delta Net → `gated-delta-net`
- NSA / Native Sparse Attention → `sparse-attention`
- WGMMA / wgmma.mma_async → `wgmma`

## Cross-Reference Fields

- `sources`: list of source IDs whose content backs this wiki page
- `related`: list of wiki page IDs that are topically related
- `prerequisites`: list of wiki page IDs the reader should read first
- `candidate_techniques` (pattern only): list of technique/hw/migration IDs that address the symptoms

## Architecture-Neutral Scope

SM90/Hopper, SM100/Blackwell, and general CUDA pages are all first-class. Architecture applicability is expressed with `architectures`; no architecture requires a special relevance-justification field.
